## About Japanese

Recently I often consume Japanese related content, and I always struggle recognizing some Kanji that I'm not familiar with. Another major problem is, our browser doesn't support <strong>furigana</strong>! I often have to open a new tab and search for the kanji meaning, which is tiring especially if I'm on a japanese forum, I have to copy and paste every replies, every discussion. 

## The Solution

I thought it would be nice if there is an extension that allow me to just hover over the kanji and see the meaning. And one day, I came upon to this amazing video

He introduces me to a browser extension called <Link href="https://yomitan.wiki/" className="text-sky-400">Yomitan</Link>, which is a browser extension that allows you to hover over kanji, press shift and Viola! It shows a popout showing how to read that Kanji and its meaning. It works Flawlessly on my chromium based browser! It also supports Firefox and even Microsoft Edge.
